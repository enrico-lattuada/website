To this aim, efforts are focused on finding novel nanomaterials for the targeted administration of drugs and bioactive molecules in the tumor sites. DNA-based hydrogels are promising candidates for these applications. However, while such materials are fairly known from a structural and physical standpoint, their effects on cell cultures are far less investigated. Here, we studied the biological response of three different cell lines (clear cell renal cell carcinoma 786-O, lung adenocarcinoma H1975 and glioblastoma U87MG) to the treatment with DNA-GEL – a DNA-based hydrogel composed of interacting DNA nanostars. Additionally, we investigated the structural modification of DNA-GELs under cell culture conditions. The results we collected show a cell type specificity of the response, with interesting implications for future applications.","tags":["DNA nanoparticles","Self-assembly"],"title":"Treatment of kidney clear cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma cell lines with hydrogels made of DNA nanostars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Lattuada","Debora Caprara","Roberto Piazza","Francesco Sciortino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638489600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638489600,"objectID":"1de628d53db3205f42fbba9db40605d9","permalink":"/publication/2021/lattuadaspatially/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/lattuadaspatially/","section":"publication","summary":"Gels of DNA nanostars, besides providing a compatible scaffold for biomedical applications, are ideal model systems for testing the physics of equilibrium colloidal gels.

Here, by using an all-optical thermal excitation technique, thermal lensing, we show that thermophoresis can be profitably exploited to investigate the self-association of an amphiphilic block copolymer, poloxamer P407, which takes place above a concentration-dependent critical micellization temperature (cmt). In particular we show that, around and above the cmt, the direction of the poloxamer thermophoretic motion displays a remarkable double sign inversion, which is fully correlated with a peak in the thermal expansivity of the solution marking the progressive dehydration of the propylene oxide groups of P407 and their incorporation into the micellar core. This rather puzzling behaviour of the thermophoretic mobility and of the Soret coefficient in the P407 micellization region can tentatively be explained by properly taking into account the temperature-dependent balance between micellized and nonassociated poloxamer chains.","tags":["Thermophoresis","Self-assembly"],"title":"Thermophoresis in self-associating systems: probing poloxamer micellization by opto-thermal excitation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Lattuada","Stefano Buzzaccaro","Roberto Piazza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1515024e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515024e3,"objectID":"059fb7b25bae36e15777e7e1e99656f2","permalink":"/publication/2018/lattuadacompressive/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018/lattuadacompressive/","section":"publication","summary":"We have investigated the stationary sedimentation profiles of colloidal gels obtained by an arrested phase-separation process driven by depletion forces, which have been compressed either by natural gravity or by a centrifugal acceleration ranging between 6$g$ and 2300$g$.

Thanks to this versatility, interparticle interactions can be easily tuned by changing solvent composition and temperature. In addition, the refractive index and density of the solvent can simultaneously match those of the NPs by adding sodium polytungstate, an organic salt widely used for density gradient centrifugation.
